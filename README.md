# Alarm

This project uses PlatformIO as it's ecosystem.
This project lights up segments of the display to show a number(s). It begins counting from number inputed by user to 0, then plays a sound from bruzzer for a second.

## Pins and corresponding segments
A = 32 
B = 28
C = 24
D = 26
E = 27
F = 31
G = 23
DP(decimal point) = 25
D1 = 33
D2 = 29
D3 = 30
D4 = 22
Buzzer = 34

## Tools used

An Arduino compatible board
Breadboard (2)
1k ohms resistors(8)
4 digit 7 segment display
Jumper wires(15)
